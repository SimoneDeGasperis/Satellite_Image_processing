The notebook sentinel5Pprocessing.ipynb explains how to process Sentinel5P data to plot NO2 emissions over Europe.
A particular study case has been presented: the NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) emissions during the 2020 lockdown and its comparison with the same period on the previous year.
The analysis showed that during the lockdown period (I only considered the period 01/04-10/04/2020) the NO2 emissions fell sharply compared to 2019 over Europe's most industrial areas.

Note: Input data are very large, severals GB and they have not been uploaded on GitHub. However, the data can be downloaded from Copernicus site https://s5phub.copernicus.eu/dhus/
